Hello World. New github member here.

I am a junior environmental technologist from Vancouver, B.C. who is having a tough time finding work in my industry. I decided I would learn to code as a new skill to improve my hireability across both industries. I love gaming and would eventually like to learn how to program some simple games for myself. However, I have a lot to learn and there is a long challenging journey ahead of me.
